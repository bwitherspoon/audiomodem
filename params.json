{"name":"AudioModem","tagline":"Digital communication with a speaker and microphone","body":"# Summary\r\n\r\nAudioModem is a narrowband digital transmitter and receiver implemented\r\nusing MATLAB®. It is intended to be a demonstration of a practical\r\nsystem and not a simulation. Using single carrier QAM digital\r\nmodulation, an image can be transmitted from one computer to another\r\nwith a typical audio card, speaker and microphone. The performance\r\nwill vary depending on your hardware. Typically a bitrate of 8\r\nkbit/s can be achieved.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\nThis transceiver demonstrates the following digital communication\r\nconcepts:\r\n\r\n- Digital modulation\r\n    - BPSK (preamble only)\r\n    - QPSK\r\n    - 16-QAM (not reliable)\r\n    - 64-QAM (not reliable)\r\n- Convolutional coding\r\n    - 1/2 rate without puncturing\r\n    - 2/3 rate with puncturing\r\n    - 3/4 rate with puncturing\r\n- Interleaving\r\n- Scrambling\r\n- Timing synchronization\r\n- Phase synchronization\r\n- Frame synchronization\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\n\r\nA recent version of MATLAB is required and only version 2014a and\r\n2014b have been tested. In addition, this project uses [System\r\nobjects][systemobjects]™ extensively. Therefore, the Communications\r\nSystems Toolbox and DSP System Toolbox are also required.\r\n\r\n[systemobjects]: http://www.mathworks.com/help/dsp/basic-operations.html\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nWhen running any of the provided examples an open file dialog will\r\nappear on the transmitter for you to select an image for transfer.  On\r\nthe receiver a constellation and spectrum plot will be shown. After the\r\nfile transfer is complete the received image will be displayed. Some\r\nstatus messages will be printed to the console. A warning will be\r\nprinted if the CRC checksum for the image is not correct.\r\n\r\nTo run a simple loop back simulation execute *runSimulateImage.m*\r\nfrom a MATLAB command prompt:\r\n\r\n    >> runSimulateImage\r\n\r\nTo transfer an image execute *runReceiveImage.m*:\r\n\r\n    >> runReceiveImage\r\n\r\nThen from another computer execute *runTransmitImage.m*:\r\n\r\n    >> runTransmitImage\r\n\r\nIt is suggested you run the transmitter and receiver applications on\r\nseparate computers. It is certainly possible to run two separate\r\nMATLAB instances on the same computer, but most audio cards have\r\nsignificant internal leakage between the input and output paths\r\ncausing the SNR to be much higher then in a realistic scenario.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nAll of the examples provided use the *SystemConfiguration* function to\r\nreturn a structure of configuration parameters. Have a look at this\r\nfile and edit only the basic configuration parameters unless you know\r\nwhat you are doing. Note that almost all of the parameters correspond\r\nto options of the MATLAB provided System objects used in the system.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nThe system is implemented using custom and MATLAB provided System\r\nobjects. Below are some short descriptions of each and some\r\ndelightful flow graphs.\r\n\r\n![System][system]\r\n\r\n## Transmitter\r\n\r\nThe transmitter class implements transmit physical layer (PHY). The\r\ninput is the payload to be transmitted as a column vector of bytes and\r\nthe output is the complex baseband samples that are to be transmitted.\r\nThe transmitter consists of a frame generator, root-raised cosine\r\n(RRC) pulse shaping filter and a digital upconverter (DUC).\r\n\r\n![Transmitter][transmitter]\r\n\r\n## Receiver\r\n\r\nThe receiver class implements the receive physical layer. The data\r\nflow is essentially the reverse of the transmitter, but with the added\r\ncomplexity of synchronization. The receiver consists of a digital\r\ndownconverter (DDC), an RRC matched filter, a symbol timing\r\nsynchronizer and a frame synchronizer.\r\n\r\n![Receiver][receiver]\r\n\r\n[system]: http://www.cae.tntech.edu/~cbwithersp42/audiomodem/system.svg\r\n[transmitter]: http://www.cae.tntech.edu/~cbwithersp42/audiomodem/transmitter.svg\r\n[receiver]: http://www.cae.tntech.edu/~cbwithersp42/audiomodem/receiver.svg\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
